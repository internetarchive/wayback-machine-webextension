What's New in v3.1

We heard you - Now you can archive using "Save Page Now" without logging into an account!

Some features still require logging in, which are indicated by an icon in place of checkboxes.

This version introduces the new "Contextual Notices" feature which checks for contextual information from fact checking organizations and origin websites while browsing the web. Off by default - Check your Settings to turn it on.

We've added two new buttons "URLs" & "Collections", tweaked some things, and fixed about a dozen bugs!
